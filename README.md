# Ghost Fishing Gear Detection using YOLOv8

This project detects ghost fishing gear in ocean environments using a YOLOv8 object detection model. Ghost gear causes marine pollution and harms sea life, so detecting it helps marine conservation efforts.

## Project Features
- Custom dataset converted to YOLO format
- Object detection using YOLOv8
- Real-time detection demo support
- Model training and evaluation scripts included

## Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLOv8
- OpenCV
- Machine Learning

## Project Structure
- train_model.py – Train detection model
- predict.py – Run detection on images
- live_demo.py – Real-time detection demo
- evaluate.py – Model performance evaluation
- yolo_data/ – Dataset in YOLO format

## Note
Model weight files are not uploaded due to GitHub size limits.

## Sample Output
Detection output samples are available in the `output_samples` folder showing model predictions on test images.
